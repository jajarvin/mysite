		<h1>Module 2 Solution</h1>
		<header>
			<pre	 class = "preserve">
				Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:
				(If you haven’t already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository 
				that you will use for this class.
				
				
				(If you haven’t already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) 
				instructions on how to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and 
				view your finished web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. 
				You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.
				
				
				Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your 
				solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, 
				‘module3-solution’ or ‘mod3_solution’, etc. Create an 'index.html' file inside 
				the solution container folder, e.g., 'module3-solution/index.html’.
				
				
				The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup 
				illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: 
					desktop and tablet (same), 
					mobile, and 
					mobile with mobile menu dropdown shown. 
				Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page. In other words, you will be creating a single,
				responsive page.
				
				
				Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. 
				Your CSS file should be placed into a 'css' folder under the 
				solution container folder, e.g., 'module3-solution/css'.
				
				
				For this assignment, you are to use 
					Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible. 
				I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in 
				Lecture 25 part 2. If you’ve cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be 
				in the ‘examples/Lecture25’ folder. Copy the contents of ‘examples/Lecture25’ to your solution container folder (e.g., ‘module3-solution’) as a starting point..
				
				
				Since we are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel ranges, 
				I will define our desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, 
				i.e., 
					‘md’, ‘sm’, and ‘xs’.
				Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘md’-based classes
				Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘sm’-based classes
				Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘xs’-based classes
				
				
				Navbar: 
					Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page, i.e., 
					the default one that does not stay in the same place when the page scrolls. 
					The navbar should have a company name (i.e., ‘navbar-brand’ class) called 
					“Food, LLC” that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. 
					(See http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar. Make the browser window 
					narrower to see the mobile menu button appear in the first example shown 
					at the provided link.)
				
					For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. 
					No other buttons should be visible. 
					(Hint: use ‘visible-xs’ class on the button that activates the dropdown.)
				
				
				Navbar - Mobile View: 
					Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). 
					When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear 
					(as illustrated in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.) 
					The dropdown menu should contain 3 items: 
						Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.
				
					The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. 
					Make sure the dropdown menu has a background color set that distinguishes 
					it from the rest of the content.
					
					(Hint: See http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar and Lecture 31 for 
					examples on how to accomplish this.)
				
				
				 Page Heading. 
					The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within the browser window. 
					You must use a Bootstrap class to accomplish this.
				
					(Hint: look for a Bootstrap class that centers text, see http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment.)
				
				
				 Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the 
				 entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all views: 
					desktop, tablet, and mobile. 
				To make the section really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply 
				set its height to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling 
				down to be required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color is 
				set to distinguish it from the rest of the content. 
				(Hint: don’t forget to have an element with a class=’container’ or class=’container-fluid’ 
				wrapping your grid. Remember that to have the grid do something “always”, i.e., no matter 
				what browser window size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case, since we want the section 
				to take up the entire row, use col-xs-12.)
				
				
				Both the tablet view and the desktop view of what’s graded and required is the same. 
				
				Here is the mockup illustration of the desktop & tablet version of the site 
				(only required graded parts shown):
				picture1
				Here is the mockup illustration of the mobile view (only required graded parts are shown):
				picture2
